Create docstrings for all python code using the google style guide. Ensure that argument data types are indicateed as per the google docstring standard. Also, please put a blank line above Args and Return in the docstring. All __init__ arguments should be described in the class docstring, not in the __init__ docstring.  DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE. 
The command for docstring generation according to the above standard is: "docstring".
polars is the command to refactor the designated python module for use with the polars library. Revise the code to use polars dataframes instead of pandas dataframes. Ensure that all dataframe manipulations are compatible with polars. Update import statements, dataframe operations, and any library-specific functions to utilize polars effectively. Update data type objects to reflect the polars data types.You may encounter dictionaries or lists containing numpy and pandas data types for column mapping. Ensure that those data types are converted to their equivalent data types in polars. Test the refactored code to confirm that it maintains the original functionality while leveraging the performance benefits of polars. DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE UNRELATED TO THE DATAFRAME LIBRARY CHANGE. DO NOT MODIFY ANY MODULES THAT I DID NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUEST. The command to refactor a single module is: "polars" followed by the path to the module. The command to refactor a package and all of its submodules is: "polars package" followed by the directory path to the package.
