Create docstrings for all python code using the google style guide. Ensure that argument data types are indicateed as per the google docstring standard. Also, please put a blank line above Args and Return in the docstring. All __init__ arguments should be described in the class docstring, not in the __init__ docstring.  DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE. 
The command for docstring generation according to the above standard is: "docstring".
