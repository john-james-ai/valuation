Create docstrings for all python code using the google style guide. Ensure that argument data types are indicateed as per the google docstring standard. All __init__ arguments should be described in the class docstring, not in the __init__ docstring.  Do not modify any code other than to add docstrings.
The command for docstring generation according to the above standard is: "docstring".
