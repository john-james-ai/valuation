This is a classic and important problem in machine learning workflows. The key is to have different-sized datasets for different stages of development.

Given your 175.5M record production set, here is a practical, tiered approach to creating your development datasets.

---

### Tier 1: The "Dev" Set (for Speed)

This dataset is for day-to-day coding, debugging your pipeline, and iterating on feature engineering. Your priority is **zero-latency cycle time**. You should be able to run your entire pipeline (load, preprocess, train, evaluate) in under a minute.

* **Recommended Total Size:** **10,000 records**
* **Purpose:**
    - Debugging data transformations and preprocessing.
    - Verifying your model's code runs without crashing.
    - Quickly testing new feature ideas.
* **Example Split (80/10/10):**
    - **Training:** 8,000 records
    - **Validation:** 1,000 records
    - **Test:** 1,000 records

A 1k-record validation set is too small to trust the *metrics* (like accuracy or F1-score), but it's perfect for verifying that your code *works*.

### Tier 2: The "Prototyping" Set (for Meaning)

This is your main dataset for *model development*. It needs to be large enough that the performance on your validation and test sets is a "meaningful" and stable signal, but small enough that you can train a model in minutes or an hour, not days.

* **Recommended Total Size:** **250,000 records** (A range of 100k to 500k is also very common).
* **Purpose:**
    - Getting a reliable estimate of model performance.
    - Running hyperparameter tuning experiments.
    - Comparing different model architectures.
* **Example Split (70/15/15):**
    - **Training:** 175,000 records
    - **Validation:** 37,500 records
    - **Test:** 37,500 records

With a ~37.5k test set, your performance metrics will be highly stable. If Model A gets 85.1% accuracy and Model B gets 85.4%, you can be reasonably confident that B is *actually* better, a conclusion you could never draw from the 1k test set.

### ðŸš¨ Critical Warning: How to Sample

Do **not** just take the `TOP 250,000` records from your database. This will introduce massive bias (e.g., all your data might be from the same day or the same users).

Your sample **must be random**.

The best method is **Stratified Random Sampling**.

1. **Identify Strata:** Find the most important categorical feature in your data, especially the **target variable** you're trying to predict (e.g., `is_fraud`, `product_category`).
2. **Sample Proportionally:** Pull a random sample, but ensure the proportions of your strata are identical to the production dataset.
3. **Example:** If your 175.5M records are 2% "fraud" and 98% "not fraud," your 250,000-record sample *must* also contain 5,000 (2%) fraud records and 245,000 (98%) non-fraud records.

This ensures your "small" dataset has the same characteristics as your "big" dataset, making it a meaningful proxy for development.

### Your Full Development Workflow

This tiered approach defines a clear development cycle:

1. **Code & Debug:** Use the **10k "Dev" set** for rapid, local iteration on your feature engineering and model scripts.
2. **Tune & Evaluate:** When your code is working, use the **250k "Prototyping" set** to run experiments, tune hyperparameters, and select your final model.
3. **Final Training:** Once you have your final model, features, and hyperparameters, train it one last time on a *much* larger dataset (e.g., 20%, 50%, or even the full 175.5M records) to create the final production artifact.
